      "Data Science is described as a field of study that includes collecting, analyzing and interpreting large \n",

      "Statistics, while others feel that Statistics is not very important to Data Science.  Many argue that Data \n",
      "\n",
      "Science is necessary for handling larger quantities of data than Statistics is capable of, but Statistics has\n",
      "\n",
      "always worked with large data sets.  Computer Scientists claim that Data Scientists have special skills \n",
