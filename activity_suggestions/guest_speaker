invite a guest speaker


* how you decided to do a PhD
* what topic your research is in
* how you chose that topic (or if someone else proposed the topic)
* what your typical day looks like
* what you plan to do with your degree
* what are other things you could potentially do with a degree
* mistakes you've made that would be relevant to data science students
* how you do research - your process
* how you collaborate with other researchers
* how you compete with other researchers
* how you apply for funding
* funding success rates

I don't know much about your research topic, but I would have more
questions about that:
* what data are you operating on (text, images, video, etc) or is your
work more theoretical?
* where do you get your data? Did you clean it? Label it?
* for computational resources, what are you using? Is this a constraint?
* how often do you publish?
* how often do you go to conferences?
* do you review other people's work?
